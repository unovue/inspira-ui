## API

| Prop Name          | Type     | Default | Description                                                                 |
| ------------------ | -------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `hue`              | `number` | `0`     | Base hue for the fractal texture (0â€“360 degrees).                           |
| `saturation`       | `number` | `1`     | Saturation of the color (0â€“1).                                              |
| `brightness`       | `number` | `1`     | Brightness multiplier for the output color (0â€“2 recommended).               |
| `speed`            | `number` | `1`     | Speed multiplier for texture animation.                                     |
| `mouseSensitivity` | `number` | `0.5`   | Controls the responsiveness of the texture to mouse movement. (0â€“1)         |
| `damping`          | `number` | `1`     | Damping factor to control the smoothness of texture distortions. (0â€“1)      |
| `class`            | `string` | `â€”`     | Optional additional CSS classes for the container div (e.g., z-index, etc). |

> ðŸ’¡ This component is designed to be used in full-screen or large section backgrounds. It is optimized for modern GPUs but may be demanding on lower-end devices.

## Features

- **Fractal and organic visual effect**: Based on raymarching, creating intricate and evolving fractal textures that simulate natural phenomena.
- **Dynamic mouse interaction**: Subtle distortions and shifts in texture based on mouse movement, creating a more immersive experience.
- **Color control**: Full control over hue, saturation, brightness, and animation speed to match your designâ€™s aesthetic.
- **Performance optimized**: Although complex, this shader is optimized for real-time performance in modern browsers and GPUs.
- **Scalable**: Can be used as a full-screen background or in smaller sections with adjustable scale and motion properties.
- **Shader-powered animation**: Real-time evolving fractal effects with smooth transitions and animations.

## Notes

- Based on a ShaderToy fragment shader by the original creator of the fractal patterns (MIT License).
- The shader uses raymarching techniques to create highly detailed, organic textures with subtle lighting effects and ambient occlusion.
- Not recommended for low-end devices as the shaderâ€™s complexity may affect performance.
- For best results, use in full-screen hero sections or large design areas.

## Credits

- Embedded in a Vue component and adapted for dynamic input via props.
- Inspired by fractal patterns, natural textures, and advanced raymarching techniques.
