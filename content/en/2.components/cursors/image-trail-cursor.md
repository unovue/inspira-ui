## Features

- **Multiple animation variants**: Choose from 7 different trail animation patterns and behaviors.
- **Dynamic image rendering**: Displays provided images with smooth opacity transitions and transforms.
- **Responsive design**: Images scale appropriately with rounded corners and overflow handling.
- **Memory management**: Automatically destroys and recreates instances when variant changes.
- **Performance optimized**: Uses `will-change` CSS property for smooth GPU-accelerated animations.
- **Flexible image support**: Accepts any array of image URLs for customizable visual content.

## Notes

- The component uses a variant system with different animation classes mapped in `trail-variants.ts`.
- Images are positioned absolutely with a slight overflow effect (20px larger with -10px offset) for smoother visual transitions.
- The container maintains a high z-index (100) to ensure the trail effect appears above other content.
- Variant instances are properly cleaned up on component unmount and variant changes to prevent memory leaks.
