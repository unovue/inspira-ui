Welcome to [**Inspira UI**](https://inspira-ui.com), a community-driven project for [Vue](https://vuejs.org)!

This collection offers beautifully designed, reusable components, taking inspiration from the amazing work done on both [Aceternity UI](https://ui.aceternity.com) and [Magic UI](https://magicui.design). While we're not officially affiliated with these projects, we have received permission from Aceternity UI's creator to adapt those fantastic designs for the Vue ecosystem. Additionally, Inspira UI includes custom components developed by us and contributed by the community.

### About Inspira UI

Inspira UI is **not** a traditional component library. Instead, it's a curated collection of elegant components you can easily integrate into your applications. Simply pick what you need, copy the code, and customize it to fit your project. The code is yours to use and modify as you like!

### Why Inspira UI?

This project began to fill a gap in the Vue community for a similar set of components. Inspira UI brings the beauty and functionality of Aceternity UI, Magic UI, and custom contributions to Vue, making it easier for developers to build stunning applications.
