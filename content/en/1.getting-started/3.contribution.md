### Adding New Components

We appreciate contributions that add new components to the library. Please ensure that:

- The component is generally useful and aligns with the project's goals.
- The component is compatible with both **Nuxt** and **Vue**.
- You follow the coding and documentation guidelines outlined below.
- You include unit tests for your component.

#### Components guidelines

1. **Create or Update `index.ts`**  
   Each folder under `components/content/inspira/ui/<component-folder-name>/` should have an `index.ts` that exports all Vue files. For example:

   ```ts
   // index.ts
   export { default as Book } from "./Book.vue";
   export { default as BookHeader } from "./BookHeader.vue";
   export { default as BookTitle } from "./BookTitle.vue";
   export { default as BookDescription } from "./BookDescription.vue";
   ```

2. **Registry Dependencies:**
   If your new component depends on (or uses) other Inspira UI components, you must update the `COMPONENT_DEPENDENCIES` map in `~/scripts/crawl-content.ts` to reflect those relationships. This helps the library understand which components should be installed together when a user adds them via the CLI.

3. **Nuxt-Only Features:**
   If your new component or its example uses Nuxt-only features such as `<ClientOnly>`, please mention this in the documentation. This ensures users know there may be limitations or additional steps when using the component outside of Nuxt.

   This ensures that users can install the component through the CLI and that all dependencies are properly declared.

4. **Avoid External Components:**
   When creating components, avoid using external UI components (like `<UiButton>` or similar) that are not part of the core Vue.js ecosystem.

5. **Explicit Imports:**
   Even if you're using Nuxt's auto-imports feature during development, always include explicit imports in your component code. This ensures compatibility with Vue.js users who don't have auto-imports. For example:

   ```vue
   <script setup lang="ts">
   import { ref, onMounted } from "vue";
   import { useWindowSize } from "@vueuse/core";
   // Include all imports explicitly
   </script>
   ```

6. **Icon Usage:**
   If you need icons in your demos or components, use the built-in `<Icon>` component rather than pasting raw SVGs into your templates.

## Project Structure

Understanding the project structure is crucial for effective contribution:

- **Components Directory**:
  - Main components should be placed in `components/content/inspira/ui/<component-folder-name>/`.
    - Include an `index.ts` file to export each component within that folder.
  - Example components should be placed in `components/content/inspira/examples/<component-folder-name>/`.
- **Documentation**:
  - Documentation files are located in the `content/2.components/<category>/` directory.
  - After adding a component, write its documentation in this directory.

## Style Guidelines

### Coding Standards

- **Language**: All components should be written in **Vue.js** with TypeScript support.
- **Styling**: Use **Tailwind CSS** classes for styling whenever possible.
- **Naming Conventions**: Use `PascalCase` for component names and filenames.

### Component Format

Your Vue components should adhere to the following structure:

```vue
<!-- Template -->
<template>
  <!-- Your template code goes here -->
</template>

<!-- Script (if required) -->
<script lang="ts" setup>
// Your script code goes here
</script>

<!-- Styles (if required) -->
<style scoped>
/* Your styles go here */
</style>
```

**Props typing and code style**

Refer to this Vue.js documentation page -> [https://vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup#type-only-props-emit-declarations](https://vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup#type-only-props-emit-declarations)

```vue
<script lang="ts" setup>
// DON'T ‚õîÔ∏è
const props = defineProps({
  whatever: { type: String, required: true },
  optional: { type: String, default: "default" },
});

// DO ‚úÖ
interface Props {
  whatever: string;
  optional?: string;
}

const props = withDefaults(defineProps<Props>(), { optional: "default" });

// Or DO ‚úÖ Props destructure (v3.5+)
interface Props {
  msg?: string;
  labels?: string[];
}

const { msg = "hello", labels = ["one", "two"] } = defineProps<Props>();
</script>
```

**Constants, interfaces, types and variants**

For reusability purposes, you can also add an `index.ts` file at the root of the component folder to export interfaces, constants, and other useful code elements. Keep in mind that developers will copy and paste the component code into their projects, so it should be very easy to customize according to their standards.

Contants have to be `CAPS_CAMEL_CASE` in order to identify them clearly inside the code. And `prefix` them.
Please never use Enums; use `{} as const` instead. üòò

```typescript
// DON'T ‚õîÔ∏è
const Direction = { Top: 'top'} as const
const ComponentNameDirection = { Top: 'top'} as const

// DON'T ‚õîÔ∏è
enum COMPONENT_NAME_DIRECTION_WRONG = { Top = 'top'};

// DO ‚úÖ
import type { ObjectValues } from "@/lib/utils";
export const COMPONENT_NAME_DIRECTION = { Top: 'top', Bottom: 'bottom'} as const

//Types and Interfaces should use CamelCase to differentiate them from constants and variables.
export type ComponentNameDirection = ObjectValues<typeof COMPONENT_NAME_DIRECTION>;

interface {
   direction: ComponentNameDirection; //Enforce correct value : 'top' or 'bottom'
}
```

You can check the `PatternBackground` component files `components/content/inspira/ui/pattern-background` for a complete example.

**Notes:**

- Use `<script lang="ts" setup>` for TypeScript and the Composition API.
- Keep styles scoped to prevent conflicts.
- Ensure compatibility with both **Nuxt** and **Vue**.

### Commit Messages

- Use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format.
- Begin with a type (`feat`, `fix`, `docs`, etc.) followed by a short description.
- Example: `feat: add TextHoverEffect component`

## Documentation Guidelines

Proper documentation is crucial for users to understand and effectively use the components. Follow these guidelines when adding documentation for new components.

### Steps to Add a New Component

1. **Create the Component**
   - Place the main component in `components/content/inspira/ui/<component-folder-name>/`.
   - Follow the [Component Format](#component-format) specified above.
   - If the component requires examples or demos, add demo components to `components/content/inspira/examples/<component-folder-name>/`.

2. **Write Documentation**
   - Add a new Markdown file in `content/2.components/<category>/` for your component's documentation.
   - Use the appropriate template based on whether your component is single-file or multi-file (see below).
   - Add utility classes section if applicable to your component.
   - Mention the **Credits** and source if the component is ported from any other UI library or taken inspiration from any other source.

3. **Ensure Compatibility**
   - Test your component in both **Nuxt** and **Vue** environments.

### Single-File Components

For components that are contained within a single `.vue` file, use the following template:

1. **Front Matter**

   Begin with YAML front matter that includes the `title` and `description`:

   ```yaml
   ---
   title: Your Component Title
   description: A brief description of what your component does.
   ---
   ```

2. **Preview Section**

   Use the `ComponentLoader` to display a live preview of the component. The `id` should be set to the folder name of your component in `components/content/inspira/examples/`. In case, there is no folder, then `id` is not required.

   ```markdown
   ::ComponentLoader{label="Preview" componentName="YourComponentDemo" type="examples" id="your-component-folder-name"}
   ::
   ```

3. **Alerts**

   If your component has special requirements or dependencies, add an alert section before the installation instructions:

   ```markdown
   ::alert{type="info"}
   **Note:** This component requires `package-name` as a dependency.
   ::

   ::alert{type="warning"}
   **Note:** This component uses the `nuxt-only` syntax with the `<ClientOnly>`. If you are not using Nuxt, you can simply remove it.
   ::
   ```

4. **Installation**

   Include both CLI and manual installation instructions. If additional setup is required (e.g., dependencies, Tailwind config updates), use a stepper to list all needed steps.

   ```markdown
   ## Install using CLI

   ::InstallationCli{componentId="your-component-folder-name"}
   ::

   ## Install Manually

   Copy and paste the following code

   ::CodeViewer{filename="YourComponent.vue" language="vue" componentName="YourComponent" type="ui" id="your-component-folder-name"}
   ::
   ```

5. **API Documentation**

   Provide a table listing all props:

   ```markdown
   ## API

   | Prop Name | Type      | Default | Description                    |
   | --------- | --------- | ------- | ------------------------------ |
   | `prop1`   | `string`  | `''`    | Description of prop1.          |
   | `prop2`   | `number`  | `0`     | Description of prop2.          |
   | `prop2`   | `?number` | `0`     | Description of prop2 optional. |
   ```

**Example:**

```markdown
---
title: Text Hover Effect
description: A text hover effect that animates and outlines gradient on hover, as seen on x.ai
---

::ComponentLoader{label="Preview" componentName="TextHoverEffectDemo" type="examples"}
::

::alert{type="warning"}
This component uses the `nuxt-only` syntax with the `<ClientOnly>`. If you are not using Nuxt, you can simply remove it.
::

## Install using CLI

::InstallationCli{componentId="text-hover-effect"}
::

## Install Manually

Copy and paste the following code

::CodeViewer{filename="TextHoverEffect.vue" language="vue" componentName="TextHoverEffect" type="ui" id="text-hover-effect"}
::

## API

| Prop Name     | Type     | Default  | Description                                               |
| ------------- | -------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `text`        | `string` | Required | The text to be displayed with the hover effect.           |
| `duration`    | `number` | `200`    | The duration of the mask transition animation in seconds. |
| `strokeWidth` | `number` | `0.75`   | The width of the text stroke.                             |
| `opacity`     | `number` | `null`   | The opacity of the text.                                  |
```

In this example, the `id` used in both `ComponentLoader`, `CodeViewer` and `InstallationCli` is `text-hover-effect`, which matches the folder name where the component and its demo are stored.

### Multi-File Components

For components that consist of multiple files, such as a main component and several sub-components or variants, use the following template:

1. **Front Matter**

   Begin with YAML front matter:

   ```yaml
   ---
   title: Your Components Group Title
   description: A brief description of what this group of components does.
   ---
   ```

2. **Preview Sections**

   Include multiple `ComponentLoader` sections for each example or variant. The `id` should be set to the folder name of your component in `components/content/inspira/examples/`.

   ```markdown
   ::ComponentLoader{label="Preview" componentName="ComponentVariantDemo" type="examples" id="your-component-folder-name"}
   ::
   ```

3. **Alerts**

   If your component has special requirements or dependencies, add an alert section before the installation instructions:

   ```markdown
   ::alert{type="info"}
   **Note:** This component requires `package-name` as a dependency.
   ::

   ::alert{type="warning"}
   **Note:** This component uses the `nuxt-only` syntax with the `<ClientOnly>`. If you are not using Nuxt, you can simply remove it.
   ::
   ```

4. **Installation**

   Include both CLI and manual installation instructions. If additional setup is required (e.g., dependencies, Tailwind config updates), use a stepper to list all needed steps.

   ```markdown
   ## Install using CLI

   ::InstallationCli{componentId="your-component-folder-name"}
   ::

   ## Install Manually

   Copy and paste the following code in the same folder

   ::code-group

   :CodeViewerTab{label="YourComponent.vue" language="vue" componentName="YourComponent" type="ui" id="your-component-folder-name"}
   :CodeViewerTab{filename="YourComponent2.vue" language="vue" componentName="YourComponent2" type="ui" id="your-component-folder-name"}

   ::
   ```

5. **API Documentation**

   Provide comprehensive API documentation covering all components:

   ```markdown
   ## API

   | Prop Name | Type     | Default | Description                             |
   | --------- | -------- | ------- | --------------------------------------- |
   | `prop1`   | `string` | `''`    | Description applicable to all variants. |
   ```

**Example:**

```markdown
---
title: Pattern Background
description: Simple animated pattern background to make your sections stand out.
---

Grid background with dot
::ComponentLoader{label="Preview" componentName="PatternBackgroundDotDemo" type="examples" id="pattern-background"}
::

## Install using CLI

::InstallationCli{componentId="pattern-background"}
::

## Install Manually

Copy and paste the following code in the same folder

::code-group

:CodeViewerTab{label="PatternBackground.vue" language="vue" componentName="PatternBackground" type="ui" id="pattern-background"}
:CodeViewerTab{filename="index.ts" language="typescript" componentName="index" type="ui" id="pattern-background" extension="ts"}

::

## Examples

Grid background with big dot and ellipse on top
::ComponentLoader{label="Preview" componentName="PatternBackgroundBigDotDemo" type="examples" id="pattern-background"}
::

Grid background without animation
::ComponentLoader{label="Preview" componentName="PatternBackgroundGridDemo" type="examples" id="pattern-background"}
::

Small grid background with animation
::ComponentLoader{label="Preview" componentName="PatternBackgroundGridSmallDemo" type="examples" id="pattern-background"}
::

## API

| Prop Name   | Type                                                                                                   | Default   | Description                                                                                                                                                    |

### Custom variants, values and constants

You can customize your needs directly within the `index.ts` file. See code below.

```

## Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests for your component if applicable.
- **Cross-Environment Testing**: Ensure that your component works correctly in both **Nuxt** and **Vue** environments.
- **Visual Testing**: Check the component visually to ensure it renders correctly.
- **CLI Installation Testing**: After updating the registry with `pnpm build:registry`, test the component installation in a separate project by referencing the local registry URL. For example:
  ```sh
  npx shadcn-vue@latest add "https://localhost:3000/r/<component-name>"
  ```

## Additional Notes

- **Component Names**: Use `PascalCase` for component filenames and names.
- **IDs**: In `CodeViewer`, `CodeViewerTab`, and `ComponentLoader`, the `id` parameter should be set to the **folder name** where the component is stored in `components/content/inspira/ui/<component-folder-name>/` and `components/content/inspira/examples/<component-folder-name>/`. This helps in correctly linking the code and examples in the documentation.
- **Demo Components**: For each component, create a corresponding `Demo` component used in the `ComponentLoader` for previews, and place it in `components/content/inspira/examples/<component-folder-name>/`.
- **Localization**: If your component supports multiple languages, include details in the documentation.
