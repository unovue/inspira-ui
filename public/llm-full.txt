## Inspira UI Components
# Introduction

Reusable components built with shadcn-vue, motion-v, and TailwindCSS

Welcome to [**Inspira UI**](https://inspira-ui.com/), a community-driven project for [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)!

This collection offers beautifully designed, reusable components, taking inspiration from the amazing work done on both [Aceternity UI](https://ui.aceternity.com/) and [Magic UI](https://magicui.design/). While we're not officially affiliated with these projects, we have received permission from Aceternity UI's creator to adapt those fantastic designs for the Vue ecosystem. Additionally, Inspira UI includes custom components developed by us and contributed by the community.

### [About Inspira UI](https://inspira-ui.com/getting-started/introduction\#about-inspira-ui)

Inspira UI is **not** a traditional component library. Instead, it's a curated collection of elegant components you can easily integrate into your applications. Simply pick what you need, copy the code, and customize it to fit your project. The code is yours to use and modify as you like!

### [Why Inspira UI?](https://inspira-ui.com/getting-started/introduction\#why-inspira-ui)

This project began to fill a gap in the Vue community for a similar set of components. Inspira UI brings the beauty and functionality of Aceternity UI, Magic UI, and custom contributions to Vue, making it easier for developers to build stunning applications.

### [Key Features](https://inspira-ui.com/getting-started/introduction\#key-features)

- Completely [free and open source](https://github.com/unovue/inspira-ui)
- Highly [configurable](https://inspira-ui.com/components) to meet your design needs
- A wide range of [components](https://inspira-ui.com/components) to choose from
- Optimized for mobile use
- Fully compatible with Nuxt

### [Acknowledgments](https://inspira-ui.com/getting-started/introduction\#acknowledgments)

Special thanks to:

- [Aceternity UI](https://ui.aceternity.com/) for inspiring this Vue adaptation.
- [Magic UI](https://magicui.design/) for their design inspiration.
- [shadcn-vue](https://www.shadcn-vue.com/) for the Vue port of shadcn-ui and contributing some components for docs.
- [shadcn-docs-nuxt](https://github.com/ZTL-UwU/shadcn-docs-nuxt) for the beautifully crafted Nuxt documentation site.

### [About Me](https://inspira-ui.com/getting-started/introduction\#about-me)

Hi, I'm [Rahul Vashishtha](https://rahulv.dev/). I started Inspira UI to bring a similar experience to the Vue ecosystem, inspired by Aceternity UI, Magic UI, and community contributions. I'm continuously working on it to make it better. Feel free to check out my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/rahul-vashishtha) and join me on this journey [here](https://github.com/unovue/inspira-ui)!

Feel free to explore and enjoy building with Inspira UI!

## Inspira UI Installation Guide
# Installation

How to install Inspira UI in your app.

This guide will help you install and set up Inspira UI components in your Vue or Nuxt application.

## [Getting Started with Inspira UI](https://inspira-ui.com/getting-started/installation\#getting-started-with-inspira-ui)

**Note:** If you're using `shadcn-vue`, you can skip step `1` & `4`.

### [Set up `tailwindcss`](https://inspira-ui.com/getting-started/installation\#set-up-tailwindcss)

Currently Inspira UI supports TailwindCSS v3. Make sure you install TailwindCSS v3.

To begin, install `tailwindcss` using [this guide](https://v3.tailwindcss.com/docs/installation).

### [Add dependencies](https://inspira-ui.com/getting-started/installation\#add-dependencies)

Install libraries for tailwindcss and utilities.

npm

pnpm

bun

yarn

```
npm install -D @inspira-ui/plugins clsx tailwind-merge class-variance-authority tailwindcss-animate

```

```
pnpm install -D @inspira-ui/plugins clsx tailwind-merge class-variance-authority tailwindcss-animate

```

```
bun add -d @inspira-ui/plugins clsx tailwind-merge class-variance-authority tailwindcss-animate

```

```
yarn add --dev @inspira-ui/plugins clsx tailwind-merge class-variance-authority tailwindcss-animate

```

Install VueUse and other supporting libraries.

npm

pnpm

bun

yarn

```
npm install @vueuse/core motion-v

```

```
pnpm install @vueuse/core motion-v

```

```
bun add @vueuse/core motion-v

```

```
yarn add @vueuse/core motion-v

```

Follow this guide to setup `motion-v` on [Vue](https://motion.unovue.com/getting-started/installation) and [Nuxt](https://motion.unovue.com/getting-started/installation)

### [Update `tailwind.config.js` and `tailwind.css`](https://inspira-ui.com/getting-started/installation\#update-tailwindconfigjs-and-tailwindcss)

Add the following code to your `tailwind.config.js` and your `css` file:

tailwind.config.js

tailwind.css

```
import animate from "tailwindcss-animate";
import { setupInspiraUI } from "@inspira-ui/plugins";

export default {
  darkMode: "selector",
  safelist: ["dark"],

### [Setup `cn` utility](https://inspira-ui.com/getting-started/installation\#setup-cn-utility)

Add following utility to `lib/utils.ts`

utils.ts

```
import { type ClassValue, clsx } from "clsx";
import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge";

export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
  return twMerge(clsx(inputs));
}

export type ObjectValues<T> = T[keyof T];

```

Great job! Your project is now configured to use Inspira UI.

### [Optional: Add Icon Support](https://inspira-ui.com/getting-started/installation\#optional-add-icon-support)

A variety of Inspira UI components and demos utilize the `<Icon>` component with Iconify icons. Although optional, we recommend installing it for an optimal experience.

To add icon support to your Vue.js or Nuxt.js project, please follow the [Iconify Vue guide](https://iconify.design/docs/icon-components/vue/).

### [Start Using Inspira UI 🚀](https://inspira-ui.com/getting-started/installation\#start-using-inspira-ui)

Now, you can start using Inspira UI components in your project. Choose the components you need, copy the code, and integrate them into your application.

```

2. **Registry Dependencies:**
If your new component depends on (or uses) other Inspira UI components, you must update the `COMPONENT_DEPENDENCIES` map in `~/scripts/crawl-content.ts` to reflect those relationships. This helps the library understand which components should be installed together when a user adds them via the CLI.
3. **Nuxt-Only Features:**
If your new component or its example uses Nuxt-only features such as `<ClientOnly>`, please mention this in the documentation. This ensures users know there may be limitations or additional steps when using the component outside of Nuxt.

This ensures that users can install the component through the CLI and that all dependencies are properly declared.
4. **Avoid External Components:**
When creating components, avoid using external UI components (like `<UiButton>` or similar) that are not part of the core Vue.js ecosystem.
5. **Explicit Imports:**
Even if you're using Nuxt's auto-imports feature during development, always include explicit imports in your component code. This ensures compatibility with Vue.js users who don't have auto-imports. For example:


















```
<script setup lang="ts">
import { ref, onMounted } from "vue";
import { useWindowSize } from "@vueuse/core";
// Include all imports explicitly
</script>

```

6. **Icon Usage:**
If you need icons in your demos or components, use the built-in `<Icon>` component rather than pasting raw SVGs into your templates.

## [Project Structure](https://inspira-ui.com/getting-started/contribution\#project-structure)

Understanding the project structure is crucial for effective contribution:

- **Components Directory**:

  - Main components should be placed in `components/content/inspira/ui/<component-folder-name>/`.

    - Include an `index.ts` file to export each component within that folder.
  - Example components should be placed in `components/content/inspira/examples/<component-folder-name>/`.
- **Documentation**:

  - Documentation files are located in the `content/2.components/<category>/` directory.
  - After adding a component, write its documentation in this directory.

## [Style Guidelines](https://inspira-ui.com/getting-started/contribution\#style-guidelines)

### [Coding Standards](https://inspira-ui.com/getting-started/contribution\#coding-standards)

- **Language**: All components should be written in **Vue.js** with TypeScript support.
- **Styling**: Use **Tailwind CSS** classes for styling whenever possible.
- **Naming Conventions**: Use `PascalCase` for component names and filenames.

### [Component Format](https://inspira-ui.com/getting-started/contribution\#component-format)

Your Vue components should adhere to the following structure:

```
<!-- Template -->
<template>
  <!-- Your template code goes here -->
</template>

<!-- Script (if required) -->
<script lang="ts" setup>
// Your script code goes here
</script>

<!-- Styles (if required) -->
<style scoped>
/* Your styles go here */
</style>

```

**Props typing and code style**

Refer to this Vue.js documentation page -> [https://vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup#type-only-props-emit-declarations](https://vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup#type-only-props-emit-declarations)

```
<script lang="ts" setup>
// DON'T ⛔️
const props = defineProps({
  whatever: { type: String, required: true },
  optional: { type: String, default: "default" },
});

// DO ✅
interface Props {
  whatever: string;
  optional?: string;
}

const props = withDefaults(defineProps<Props>(), { optional: "default" });

// Or DO ✅ Props destructure (v3.5+)
interface Props {
  msg?: string;
  labels?: string[];
}

const { msg = "hello", labels = ["one", "two"] } = defineProps<Props>();
</script>

```

**Constants, interfaces, types and variants**

For reusability purposes, you can also add an `index.ts` file at the root of the component folder to export interfaces, constants, and other useful code elements. Keep in mind that developers will copy and paste the component code into their projects, so it should be very easy to customize according to their standards.

Contants have to be `CAPS_CAMEL_CASE` in order to identify them clearly inside the code. And `prefix` them.
Please never use Enums; use `{} as const` instead. 😘

```
// DON'T ⛔️
const Direction = { Top: 'top'} as const
const ComponentNameDirection = { Top: 'top'} as const

// DON'T ⛔️
enum COMPONENT_NAME_DIRECTION_WRONG = { Top = 'top'};

// DO ✅
import type { ObjectValues } from "@/lib/utils";
export const COMPONENT_NAME_DIRECTION = { Top: 'top', Bottom: 'bottom'} as const

//Types and Interfaces should use CamelCase to differentiate them from constants and variables.
export type ComponentNameDirection = ObjectValues<typeof COMPONENT_NAME_DIRECTION>;

interface {
   direction: ComponentNameDirection; //Enforce correct value : 'top' or 'bottom'
}

```

You can check the `PatternBackground` component files `components/content/inspira/ui/pattern-background` for a complete example.

**Notes:**

- Use `<script lang="ts" setup>` for TypeScript and the Composition API.
- Keep styles scoped to prevent conflicts.
- Ensure compatibility with both **Nuxt** and **Vue**.

### [Commit Messages](https://inspira-ui.com/getting-started/contribution\#commit-messages)

- Use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format.
- Begin with a type ( `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, etc.) followed by a short description.
- Example: `feat: add TextHoverEffect component`

## [Documentation Guidelines](https://inspira-ui.com/getting-started/contribution\#documentation-guidelines)

Proper documentation is crucial for users to understand and effectively use the components. Follow these guidelines when adding documentation for new components.

### [Steps to Add a New Component](https://inspira-ui.com/getting-started/contribution\#steps-to-add-a-new-component)

1. **Create the Component**
   - Place the main component in `components/content/inspira/ui/<component-folder-name>/`.
   - Follow the [Component Format](https://inspira-ui.com/getting-started/contribution#component-format) specified above.
   - If the component requires examples or demos, add demo components to `components/content/inspira/examples/<component-folder-name>/`.
2. **Write Documentation**
   - Add a new Markdown file in `content/2.components/<category>/` for your component's documentation.
   - Use the appropriate template based on whether your component is single-file or multi-file (see below).
   - Add utility classes section if applicable to your component.
   - Mention the **Credits** and source if the component is ported from any other UI library or taken inspiration from any other source.
3. **Ensure Compatibility**
   - Test your component in both **Nuxt** and **Vue** environments.

### [Single-File Components](https://inspira-ui.com/getting-started/contribution\#single-file-components)

For components that are contained within a single `.vue` file, use the following template:

1. **Front Matter**

Begin with YAML front matter that includes the `title` and `description`:


















```
   ---
title: Your Component Title
description: A brief description of what your component does.
   ---

```

2. **Preview Section**

Use the `ComponentLoader` to display a live preview of the component. The `id` should be set to the folder name of your component in `components/content/inspira/examples/`. In case, there is no folder, then `id` is not required.


















```
::ComponentLoader{label="Preview" componentName="YourComponentDemo" type="examples" id="your-component-folder-name"}
::

```

3. **Alerts**

If your component has special requirements or dependencies, add an alert section before the installation instructions:


















```
::alert{type="info"}
**Note:** This component requires `package-name` as a dependency.
::

::alert{type="warning"}
**Note:** This component uses the `nuxt-only` syntax with the `<ClientOnly>`. If you are not using Nuxt, you can simply remove it.
::

```

4. **Installation**

Include both CLI and manual installation instructions. If additional setup is required (e.g., dependencies, Tailwind config updates), use a stepper to list all needed steps.


















```
## Install using CLI

::InstallationCli{componentId="your-component-folder-name"}
::

## Install Manually

Copy and paste the following code

::CodeViewer{filename="YourComponent.vue" language="vue" componentName="YourComponent" type="ui" id="your-component-folder-name"}
::

```

5. **API Documentation**

Provide a table listing all props:


















```
## API

| Prop Name | Type      | Default | Description                    |
| --------- | --------- | ------- | ------------------------------ |
| `prop1`   | `string`  | `''`    | Description of prop1.          |
| `prop2`   | `number`  | `0`     | Description of prop2.          |
| `prop2`   | `?number` | `0`     | Description of prop2 optional. |

```


**Example:**

```
---
title: Text Hover Effect
description: A text hover effect that animates and outlines gradient on hover, as seen on x.ai
---

::ComponentLoader{label="Preview" componentName="TextHoverEffectDemo" type="examples"}
::

::alert{type="warning"}
This component uses the `nuxt-only` syntax with the `<ClientOnly>`. If you are not using Nuxt, you can simply remove it.
::

## Install using CLI

::InstallationCli{componentId="text-hover-effect"}
::

## Install Manually

Copy and paste the following code

::CodeViewer{filename="TextHoverEffect.vue" language="vue" componentName="TextHoverEffect" type="ui" id="text-hover-effect"}
::

## API

| Prop Name     | Type     | Default  | Description                                               |
| ------------- | -------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `text`        | `string` | Required | The text to be displayed with the hover effect.           |
| `duration`    | `number` | `200`    | The duration of the mask transition animation in seconds. |
| `strokeWidth` | `number` | `0.75`   | The width of the text stroke.                             |
| `opacity`     | `number` | `null`   | The opacity of the text.                                  |

```

In this example, the `id` used in both `ComponentLoader`, `CodeViewer` and `InstallationCli` is `text-hover-effect`, which matches the folder name where the component and its demo are stored.

### [Multi-File Components](https://inspira-ui.com/getting-started/contribution\#multi-file-components)

For components that consist of multiple files, such as a main component and several sub-components or variants, use the following template:

1. **Front Matter**

Begin with YAML front matter:


















```
   ---
title: Your Components Group Title
description: A brief description of what this group of components does.
   ---

```

2. **Preview Sections**

Include multiple `ComponentLoader` sections for each example or variant. The `id` should be set to the folder name of your component in `components/content/inspira/examples/`.


















```
::ComponentLoader{label="Preview" componentName="ComponentVariantDemo" type="examples" id="your-component-folder-name"}
::

```

3. **Alerts**

If your component has special requirements or dependencies, add an alert section before the installation instructions:


















```
::alert{type="info"}
**Note:** This component requires `package-name` as a dependency.
::

::alert{type="warning"}
**Note:** This component uses the `nuxt-only` syntax with the `<ClientOnly>`. If you are not using Nuxt, you can simply remove it.
::

```

4. **Installation**

Include both CLI and manual installation instructions. If additional setup is required (e.g., dependencies, Tailwind config updates), use a stepper to list all needed steps.


















```
## Install using CLI

::InstallationCli{componentId="your-component-folder-name"}
::

## Install Manually

Copy and paste the following code in the same folder

::code-group

:CodeViewerTab{label="YourComponent.vue" language="vue" componentName="YourComponent" type="ui" id="your-component-folder-name"}
:CodeViewerTab{filename="YourComponent2.vue" language="vue" componentName="YourComponent2" type="ui" id="your-component-folder-name"}

::

```

5. **API Documentation**

Provide comprehensive API documentation covering all components:


















```
## API

| Prop Name | Type     | Default | Description                             |
| --------- | -------- | ------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `prop1`   | `string` | `''`    | Description applicable to all variants. |

```


**Example:**

```
---
title: Pattern Background
description: Simple animated pattern background to make your sections stand out.
---

Grid background with dot
::ComponentLoader{label="Preview" componentName="PatternBackgroundDotDemo" type="examples" id="pattern-background"}
::

## Install using CLI

::InstallationCli{componentId="pattern-background"}
::

## Install Manually

Copy and paste the following code in the same folder

::code-group

:CodeViewerTab{label="PatternBackground.vue" language="vue" componentName="PatternBackground" type="ui" id="pattern-background"}
:CodeViewerTab{filename="index.ts" language="typescript" componentName="index" type="ui" id="pattern-background" extension="ts"}

::

## Examples

Grid background with big dot and ellipse on top
::ComponentLoader{label="Preview" componentName="PatternBackgroundBigDotDemo" type="examples" id="pattern-background"}
::

Grid background without animation
::ComponentLoader{label="Preview" componentName="PatternBackgroundGridDemo" type="examples" id="pattern-background"}
::

Small grid background with animation
::ComponentLoader{label="Preview" componentName="PatternBackgroundGridSmallDemo" type="examples" id="pattern-background"}
::

## API

| Prop Name   | Type                                                                                                   | Default   | Description                                                                                                                                                    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `animate`   | `boolean`                                                                                              | `false`   | Set `true` if you want to animate the background.                                                                                                              |
| `direction` | `top` \| `bottom` \| `left` \| `right` \| `top-left` \| `top-right` \| `bottom-left` \| `bottom-right` | `top`     | Direction of the animation movement. You can use the const `PATTERN_BACKGROUND_DIRECTION.`                                                                     |
| `direction` | `grid` \| `dot`                                                                                        | `grid`    | Type of pattern. You can use the const `PATTERN_BACKGROUND_VARIANT.`                                                                                           |
| `size`      | `xs` \| `sm` \| `md` \| `lg`                                                                           | `md`      | Size of the background pattern.                                                                                                                                |

```

## [Testing](https://inspira-ui.com/getting-started/contribution\#testing)

- **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests for your component if applicable.
- **Cross-Environment Testing**: Ensure that your component works correctly in both **Nuxt** and **Vue** environments.
- **Visual Testing**: Check the component visually to ensure it renders correctly.
- **CLI Installation Testing**: After updating the registry with `pnpm build:registry`, test the component installation in a separate project by referencing the local registry URL. For example:



















```
npx shadcn-vue@latest add "https://localhost:3000/r/<component-name>"

```


## [Additional Notes](https://inspira-ui.com/getting-started/contribution\#additional-notes)

- **Component Names**: Use `PascalCase` for component filenames and names.
- **IDs**: In `CodeViewer`, `CodeViewerTab`, and `ComponentLoader`, the `id` parameter should be set to the **folder name** where the component is stored in `components/content/inspira/ui/<component-folder-name>/` and `components/content/inspira/examples/<component-folder-name>/`. This helps in correctly linking the code and examples in the documentation.
- **Demo Components**: For each component, create a corresponding `Demo` component used in the `ComponentLoader` for previews, and place it in `components/content/inspira/examples/<component-folder-name>/`.
- **Localization**: If your component supports multiple languages, include details in the documentation.

## [API](https://inspira-ui.com/components/backgrounds/falling-stars\#api)

| Prop Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `color` | `string` | `"#FFF"` | Color of the stars in the starfield. |
| `count` | `number` | `200` | Number of stars displayed in the animation. |

## [Features](https://inspira-ui.com/components/backgrounds/falling-stars\#features)

- **Dynamic Starfield**: Creates a 3D starfield effect with stars moving toward the viewer.
- **Glowing and Sharp Trail Effects**: Each star has a sharp line and a blurred, glowing trail.
- **Customizable**: Adjust the `color` of the stars and control the number of stars using the `count` prop.
- **Responsive Design**: Automatically adapts to the size of the canvas, ensuring a full-screen starfield effect.

## [Credits](https://inspira-ui.com/components/backgrounds/falling-stars\#credits)

- Inspired by 3D starfield simulations and trail effects in modern canvas animations.
- Credit to [Prodromos Pantos](https://github.com/prpanto) for porting the original component to Vue & Nuxt.

| Prop Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `class` | `string` | `""` | Additional CSS classes for custom styling. |

## [Features](https://inspira-ui.com/components/miscellaneous/tracing-beam\#features)

- **Dynamic Tracing Beam**: Renders a gradient tracing beam that follows the scroll position, adding a modern visual effect.
- **Scroll-Based Animation**: As the user scrolls, the beam animates along a path with varying gradients, responding to scroll depth.
- **Gradient Transition**: Smoothly transitions colors along the beam from cyan to purple with fading edges for a subtle effect.
- **Slot-Based Content**: Supports a default slot to add content inside the tracing beam container.

## [API](https://inspira-ui.com/components/text-animations/text-scroll-reveal\#api)

| Prop Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `text` | `string` | N/A | The text content to display and reveal word by word during scroll. |
| `class` | `string` | `""` | Additional CSS classes to apply to the component for customization. |

## [Features](https://inspira-ui.com/components/text-animations/text-scroll-reveal\#features)

- **Scroll-Activated Text Reveal**: The component reveals the provided text word by word as the user scrolls, creating an engaging visual effect.
- **Customizable Text Content**: Set the `text` prop to display any text content you wish to reveal during scroll.
- **Smooth Animations**: Each word's opacity transitions smoothly based on scroll position, providing a visually appealing experience.
- **Styling Flexibility**: Use the `class` prop to pass additional CSS classes for custom styling.
- **Reactive Design**: The component uses Vue's reactivity system to update the scroll progress and word visibility in real-time.

## Inspira UI Components
# Introduction

Reusable components built with shadcn-vue, motion-v, and TailwindCSS

Welcome to [**Inspira UI**](https://inspira-ui.com/), a community-driven project for [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)!

This collection offers beautifully designed, reusable components, taking inspiration from the amazing work done on both [Aceternity UI](https://ui.aceternity.com/) and [Magic UI](https://magicui.design/). While we're not officially affiliated with these projects, we have received permission from Aceternity UI's creator to adapt those fantastic designs for the Vue ecosystem. Additionally, Inspira UI includes custom components developed by us and contributed by the community.

### [About Inspira UI](https://inspira-ui.com/getting-started/introduction\#about-inspira-ui)

Inspira UI is **not** a traditional component library. Instead, it's a curated collection of elegant components you can easily integrate into your applications. Simply pick what you need, copy the code, and customize it to fit your project. The code is yours to use and modify as you like!

### [Why Inspira UI?](https://inspira-ui.com/getting-started/introduction\#why-inspira-ui)

This project began to fill a gap in the Vue community for a similar set of components. Inspira UI brings the beauty and functionality of Aceternity UI, Magic UI, and custom contributions to Vue, making it easier for developers to build stunning applications.

### [Key Features](https://inspira-ui.com/getting-started/introduction\#key-features)

- Completely [free and open source](https://github.com/unovue/inspira-ui)
- Highly [configurable](https://inspira-ui.com/components) to meet your design needs
- A wide range of [components](https://inspira-ui.com/components) to choose from
- Optimized for mobile use
- Fully compatible with Nuxt

### [Acknowledgments](https://inspira-ui.com/getting-started/introduction\#acknowledgments)

Special thanks to:

- [Aceternity UI](https://ui.aceternity.com/) for inspiring this Vue adaptation.
- [Magic UI](https://magicui.design/) for their design inspiration.
- [shadcn-vue](https://www.shadcn-vue.com/) for the Vue port of shadcn-ui and contributing some components for docs.
- [shadcn-docs-nuxt](https://github.com/ZTL-UwU/shadcn-docs-nuxt) for the beautifully crafted Nuxt documentation site.

### [About Me](https://inspira-ui.com/getting-started/introduction\#about-me)

Hi, I'm [Rahul Vashishtha](https://rahulv.dev/). I started Inspira UI to bring a similar experience to the Vue ecosystem, inspired by Aceternity UI, Magic UI, and community contributions. I'm continuously working on it to make it better. Feel free to check out my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/rahul-vashishtha) and join me on this journey [here](https://github.com/unovue/inspira-ui)!

Feel free to explore and enjoy building with Inspira UI!

## [API](https://inspira-ui.com/components/miscellaneous/marquee\#api)

| Prop Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `class` | `string` | `''` | Custom CSS classes to apply to the outermost container of the marquee. |
| `reverse` | `boolean` | `false` | Sets the scrolling direction to reverse (right to left or bottom to top). |
| `pauseOnHover` | `boolean` | `false` | Pauses the marquee animation when hovered. |
| `vertical` | `boolean` | `false` | Sets the scrolling direction to vertical instead of horizontal. |
| `repeat` | `number` | `4` | Number of times the content inside the marquee should be repeated. |

## [Features](https://inspira-ui.com/components/miscellaneous/marquee\#features)

- **Horizontal & Vertical Scrolling**: You can scroll the content horizontally (default) or vertically with the `vertical` prop.
- **Reverse Direction**: Enable reverse scrolling for dynamic effects using the `reverse` prop.
- **Pause on Hover**: Pauses the scrolling animation when the user hovers over the marquee.
- **Content Repetition**: The `repeat` prop controls how many times the content inside the marquee will loop.
- **Custom Duration and Gap**: You can control the animation duration and gap between the repeated items using CSS variables `--duration` and `--gap`.

## [CSS Variables](https://inspira-ui.com/components/miscellaneous/marquee\#css-variables)

You can customize the speed and gap between the items by setting the following CSS variables:

- **`--duration`**: Controls the speed of the marquee animation.
- **`--gap`**: Sets the space between repeated items in the marquee.

## [Features](https://inspira-ui.com/components/miscellaneous/marquee\#features-1)

- **Fully Customizable**: Easily adjust the duration, gap, direction, and hover behavior to suit your needs.
- **Smooth Transitions**: The component uses CSS keyframes to achieve smooth scrolling and transitions.
- **Multi-Directional**: Scroll content either horizontally or vertically with a simple prop change.
- **Content Flexibility**: Place any Vue components or HTML elements inside the marquee slot for dynamic content scrolling.

## [Features](https://inspira-ui.com/components/visualization/orbit\#features)

- **Circular Orbit Animation**: The component animates its content in a smooth circular orbit around the center point.
- **Customizable Animation**: The orbit’s duration, delay, and radius are fully adjustable, providing flexibility in animation behavior.
- **Optional Orbit Path**: An optional visual representation of the orbit path can be toggled using the `path` prop.
- **Reversibility**: The orbit direction can be `reverse` by setting the `direction` prop.
- **Responsive and Efficient**: The component handles different container sizes and uses Vue’s reactivity to ensure efficient animation.
