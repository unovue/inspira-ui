Welcome to [**Inspira UI**](https://inspira-ui.com), a community-driven project that brings the beauty and functionality of both [Aceternity UI](https://ui.aceternity.com) and [Magic UI](https://magicui.design) to the [Vue](https://vuejs.org) & [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com) ecosystem! While this project draws inspiration from these sources, it also includes unique custom components contributed by the community and created by us.
For **Chinese version** visit [here](README_CN.md).

## ✨ About Inspira UI

Inspira UI is a collection of elegant, ready-to-use Vue components designed to be flexible and easy to integrate. Rather than being a traditional component library, it allows you to pick, customize, and adapt components as needed, giving you the freedom to shape them to fit your unique project requirements.

## 🚀 Why Inspira UI?

Inspira UI was created to fill a gap in the Vue community by providing a set of components with the aesthetics and functionality of both Aceternity UI and Magic UI. Our goal is to empower developers to build beautiful applications more efficiently while adding our own custom and community-driven designs.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Free and Open Source**: Completely [open source](https://github.com/unovue/inspira-ui) under the MIT license.
- **Highly Configurable**: Tailor components to your specific design needs. Check out our [configuration guide](/api/configuration).
- **Diverse Component Range**: A broad selection of [components](/components), inspired by Aceternity UI, Magic UI, and custom contributions, to help you build anything you imagine.
- **Mobile Optimized**: Designed to look great on all devices.
- **Nuxt Compatibility**: Fully compatible with [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com).
